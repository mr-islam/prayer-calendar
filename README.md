# prayer-calendar
Easily export Muslim prayer times into a file suitable for your Calendar

Inspired by https://github.com/jarfile/praytimes-ics/blob/wiki/ProjectHome.md

This app will be developed after making a simpler webapp for just viewing prayer times for your self. *Maybe I should have made this repo for that, then forked it into a calendar generator*…
That would be simpler because, there would be no need to handle generating an `.ical` file by using some API.

To-do, inshaAllah ﷻ:

- make a viewable website for prayer times
-- using http://praytimes.org
-- just like their simple example: a table with names of the prayers, and corresponding time for the day
- add options to it
-- fiqh, method, etc.
- make it pretty
-- css that thing, boy

- instead of showing user an output, generate a file
-- think of how to do it in a static app — API from cal maker, export a text file for manual user conversion to cal using a webapp, etc.
